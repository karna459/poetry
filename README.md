Create a comprehensive README.md file that explains how to use your repository, including how to run the Python and Java programs, set up pre-commit hooks, and deploy via GitHub Actions. Here's an example structure:

# Hello World Deployment

This repository contains simple "Hello World" programs in Python and Java. It also includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.8 (for Python program)
- Java 11 (for Java program)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-world-deployment.git
   cd hello-world-deployment

For Python, navigate to the python directory and install dependencies:

cd python
pip install -r requirements.txt

For Java, navigate to the java directory and compile the code:

cd ../java
javac Hello.java

Usage
Python
Run the Python "Hello World" program:

cd python
python hello.py

Java
Run the Java "Hello World" program:

cd java
java Hello

Pre-Commit Hooks (Optional)
To ensure code quality before committing, set up pre-commit hooks:

Install pre-commit:

pip install pre-commit

Install hooks:
pre-commit install

Now, flake8 will check Python code for style issues before each commit.

GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions workflows are set up to deploy the Python and Java programs on each push to the main branch. No additional setup is required.

License
This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.


Make sure to replace `karna4591` with your GitHub username in the README and update any other information as needed.

Now you have a GitHub repository with Python and Java "Hello World" programs, pre-commit hooks, and GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment. Users can follow the README instructions to run the code and set up pre-commit hooks.
